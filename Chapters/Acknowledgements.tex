This work would not be possible without the unceasing supervison, innumerable counseling and unrelenting persuasion of my Ph.D. advisor Professor Yasuyuki Nogami.
I am indebted to \textit{Nogami Sensei} for having me in his lab \textit{(Information Security Lab.)} as a doctoral student and mentoring me on this work.
He taught me how to analyze complex problems from different perspectives and express the ideas from pen and papers to a fully publishable article.
I enjoyed his insightful comments on the research topics during our discussions.
Sometimes his in depth queries bewildered me and influenced my ideas in this thesis.
He guided me  in different ways to approach a problem and the need to be persistent to accomplish my goal. 
He made my stay in the lab an more than a workplace. 

He also made the MORIKAWA Lab a wonderful workplace and home for the past five years. Furthermore, Prof. Morikawa's role in developing my writing and presentation skills was paramount.
Although he was very much strict with me on the research, he is very kind to me in the life. 


I am grateful to a large number of people who have directly and indirectly helped me finish this work.
First of all, I would like to express my deep gratitude to Professor Yoshitaka Morikawa, my supervisor, who has granted me the chance to start this research, and has given me innumerable advices and unrelenting encouragement.
I am also grateful to Associate Professor Yasuyuki Nogami for his continuous support, many insightful comments, and helpful discussions, which inspired many of the ideas in this thesis.  He was always there to give advice and helpful comment, to proofread and mark up my papers. 
I would also like to thank Associate Professor Toru Nakanishi, the members of my thesis committee,  for taking time to read my thesis and for their insightful comments and helpful advice. He provided me the basic idea of the research work and guided me through the thesis process. His strong work ethic and passion for science were not only inspiring, but also contagious. He really helped me a lot. 
I am very grateful to associate professor \mbox{Nobumoto Yamane} who advised some important comments at progress meeting.

I am also grateful to all present and past members of Morikawa Laboratory, Okayama University.

Finally, I would like to dedicate this thesis to my parents \mbox{Ms. Keiko Sakemi} and \mbox{Mr. Junichi Sakemi}, in appreciation of their generous support and continuous encouragement. 





The work described in this thesis would not have been possible without the strong scientific, educational, and financial support of professor Yoshitaka Morikawa, associate professor Nobumoto Yamane and assistant professor Yasuyuki Nogami. They are very much responsible for helping me complete the doctoral program. I am especially fortunate that they afforded me a lot of opportunities to attend international conferences.

I would like to thank assistant professor Yasuyuki Nogami for his useful advice and helpful discussion. He spent much time to teach me the finite field, which made it possible for me to do the research on cryptography. He provided me the basic idea of the research work and guided me through the thesis process. His strong work ethic and passion for science were not only inspiring, but also contagious. He really helped me a lot. Without their encouragement and constant guidance, I could not graduate from Okayama University in three years.
